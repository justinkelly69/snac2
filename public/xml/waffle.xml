Chapter One - Down the Rabbit Hole: Alice, a seven-year-old girl, is feeling bored and drowsy while sitting on the riverbank with her elder sister. She notices a talking, clothed white rabbit with a pocket <b>watch run past. She follows it down a rabbit hole where she suddenly falls a long way to a curious hall with many <i>locked doors</i> of all sizes. She finds a little key to a door too small  for her to <u>fit through, but through it, she sees an <r>attractive garden now</r> She then discovers</u> a bottle on a table labelled "DRINK ME," the contents of which</b> cause her to shrink too small to reach the key which she had left on the table. She subsequently eats a cake labelled "EAT ME" in currants as the chapter closes.
